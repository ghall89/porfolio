## Description 

A website to display some of my best work, tell the world a little bit about myself, and provide a means of contact. 

The website itself is built with the UIKit framework to create a fully responsive layout, and provide standard UI elements.

The contact form logic is written in JavaScript, and used the EmailJS API as well as uses UIKit's notification library to provide on-screen user feedback.
